# About

- Analog signals are present all around us, may it be **temperature, heart rate or sound**;
- These signals need to be converted to digital form so that our computers can process and analyse the signals easily;

- So, I will include some signal processing techniques that I do in my lab along with some additional information to get you started;
- The motivation behind this is after getting yourself acquainted with the methods you can explore more in the world of **sensors, IoT, data processing and much more**;

> Arduino Uno has 2 kilo bytes SRAM and 32 kilo bytes flash memory

- **MATLAB**(Octave or Python may also serve as an alternative to visualize plots);

# Lab 01

## Filters

- Filter is a system that either allows or rejects specific frequency components in the input to produce an output.
- There are many types of filters

$$y[n]=\sum_{k=0}^{L-1}(x[n-k])$$
