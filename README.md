# About

- Analog signals are present all around us, may it be **temperature, heart rate or sound**;
- These signals need to be converted to digital form so that our computers can process and analyse the signals easily;
- So, I will include some signal processing techniques that I do in my lab along with some additional information to get you started;
- The motivation behind this is after getting yourself acquainted with the methods you can explore more in the world of **sensors, IoT, data processing and much more**;
